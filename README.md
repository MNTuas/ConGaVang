# CONCLUSION

-After the assignment, I feel that I have learned a lot of knowledge and feel very satisfied with the results I have achieved because when I first entered I did not know anything about Java web. When working on a project, I encountered a lot of problems with the booking page as well as checking for each chair and ordering seats at the same time of 2 customers. As well as I have fixed a lot of errors in the function of updating customer accounts, updating movies with data errors in sql. In the end I feel that this course and project gave me an insight into how a website works and how it is managed.

-Upon successfully concluding this project, I am filled with immense satisfaction and joy. This endeavor stands as a remarkable accomplishment within the realm of my expertise, representing one of the most innovative undertakings I have pursued to date.

-After completing this project, I realized things did not turn out as I had imagined. Even for a simple imaginary function, I had to invest a lot of time and effort, which lasted more than a week. Honestly, the most challenging aspect was the database which kept me up all night thinking of the right solution for the website. I indeed doubted my ability to handle this project, but with the cooperation of three members, I almost completed my first web project. Thank you, guys gg
